# Week-1-Task
Python Practice – Fundamentals & OOP

This repository contains the Python programs I worked on to practice core programming concepts and Object-Oriented Programming.
The main focus was to strengthen my basics and get more comfortable with writing clean and structured code.

It includes practice problems, OOP implementations, and some basic test cases to verify correctness.

Project Structure
1️⃣ exercises/

This folder contains programs based on basic Python concepts.
It covers:

Variables and Data Types

Conditional Statements (if-else)

Loops (for and while)

Functions

Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries

String Manipulation

Recursion

Basic logic-building programs (Prime numbers, Fibonacci series, etc.)

I used this section mainly to revise fundamentals and improve problem-solving speed and clarity.

2️⃣ oops/

This folder focuses on Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python.

Topics covered:

Classes and Objects

Constructors

Instance and Class Variables

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

Method Overriding

Static Methods and Class Methods

These programs helped me understand how OOP works in real scenarios and how to structure code properly.

3️⃣ tests/

This folder contains simple test cases written to check whether the programs are working correctly.

It includes:

Input-output verification

Basic assertion-based tests

Edge case handling

This part helped me improve debugging and ensure my logic works for different scenarios.

Purpose of This Repository

Strengthen Python fundamentals

Practice and apply OOP concepts

Improve logical thinking and coding approach

Prepare for coding interviews

Write cleaner and more testable code
